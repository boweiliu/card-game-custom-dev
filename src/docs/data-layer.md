# Data Transfer Layers Documentation

This document outlines the data transfer layers within our project, spanning the frontend, backend, and database. It provides an overview of how data flows through the system and the key components involved.

## Data Flow Diagram

Below is an improved ASCII diagram representing the data flow pipeline:
