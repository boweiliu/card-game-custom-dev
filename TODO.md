# TODO List

1. [DONE] Set up a linter such as Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting across the project.
2. [DONE] Modify `npm run dev` to automatically spin up the backend server along with the frontend.
3. Fix webpack configs so it knows the backend proxy port is 43210
4. [DONE] Fix backend so it serves something reasonable on '/' as well, maybe ping again
5. Fix 'npm run build:fe' to actually use webpack
