# TODO List

1. Make spinner into a standalone reusable component that can elide what else is being loaded
2. Bottom "start bar" - put a HUD there, as well as hamburger to a debug menu etc. eventually
3. 2 large card rows - one at top and one at bottom. Fill them with placeholder cards for now (7x12, tarot dimensions)
4. Special areas at the left or right of the card rows, e.g. for the deck
5. Card interaction - when one is selected it takes up the ENTIRE screen, then actions are available like highlight it, move it somewhere
6. Interact with the deck to: view it unsorted, sorted, or bubble shuffle it
7. Start menu swaps between 3-4 user screens and 3-4 dev/debug screens
8. On the dev screen, we can edit the text on the cards
